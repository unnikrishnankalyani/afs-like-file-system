The scalability tests are generally 'hardcoded'.
In this test, 50 AFS clients run in the same machine (with different temporary caches and persisten storages) and communicate with AFS server (in another machine).
temporary caches: ../cmake/build/scale0(0-49)/fuse/
persistent storages: ~/storage0(0-49)

prerequisite:
- Client program in this folder
- A file in server named "scale"

test:
bash ../camke/build/clear_mount.sh
bash scale_clients.sh
bash scale_test_read/write.sh
